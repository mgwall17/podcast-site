# About Jose Zaragoza

Host of Horror Glass Podcast, exploring the psychological depths of horror cinema

## My Story

I'm a recent graduate of the Masters in Digital Marketing program at Arizona State University. Armed with a passion for horror and a freshly minted degree, I've embarked on an expedition to bring you the spine-chilling wonders of my Horror Glass Podcast.

My fascination with horror films goes beyond the surface scares. I'm deeply interested in the psychological impact these movies have on viewers and how they reflect our deepest fears and anxieties. Through Horror Glass Podcast, I explore these themes with guests who share their personal connections to horror cinema.
